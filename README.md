Game hosted at  https://clementgyx.github.io/Blackjack_project/

Scope of project:
I started with the idea of re-creating blackjack in javascript for my game assignment. It was originally going to be simplified into the player's hand not going over 21. 
I quickly realized how boring it was to play by yourself and implemented a dealer AI to pit against the player. 

Learning points:
Writting the code for this project was very tricky, as there were many logic statements and conditions to check for after just dealing out the cards. Everything needed to be updated properly and in sequence or the game would throw error after error. 

 Features I hope to implement in the future.

-Letting ace count as 11 or 1

-Allowing player to split hands

-Updating the player to properly reflect the currecnt hand

-Player starting buy-in amount 

-Ability to add bets

*Special thanks to Alex for having to the patience to guide me through the iterative process, and pointing out mistakes in my code!*
